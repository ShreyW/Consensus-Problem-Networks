Abstract: "In a consensus protocol an agreement among agents is achieved thanks to the collaborative efforts of all agents, expresses by a communication graph with nonnegative weights. The question
we ask in this paper is the following: is it possible to achieve a form of agreement also in presence of antagonistic interactions, modeled as negative weights on the communication graph."
